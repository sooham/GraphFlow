# Graphflow 2.0 PLAN

## The game story

Why? - Integrating a convincing storyline into the game will provide a sense of
purpose for the player, make the game more interactive and enjoyable, and provide
a sense of satisfaction to the player during the possibly meticulous parts and
 closure.

* You are introduced to the player as the ordinary floorbot - your job is to
maintain the UnityLab's complex - ensuring that all floor is neat and tidy.

You are guided through the tutorial lessons - designed to teach basic control
flow and program execution ideas.

* At the end of one of these tutorials you meet you get united with your floorbot
- who was made in the same factory as you and is also cleaning UnityLab - 
childhood sweethearts. He explains recursion to you.

Later your lover is kidnapped and taken away by a plumber (search asset store)
for fixing and you have navigate the labs to find him - whilst keeping up the
cleaning.

###The levels for navigation
* Continuous Challenge - setting clear short-term goals appropriate to the level
- perhaps we could add an optional task for the floor bot to do in order to get
more points? a la cut the rope?

 * Tutorial level 01 - basic movement 
 * moving and turning
 * checking the nodes contents
 * accessing the nodes contents
 * changing the nodes contents
 * picking up the nodes value
 * inserting the values into the node

 * advanced level combining moving and turning
 * recursion moving simple
 * moving tree base case
 * moving tree one level
 -- kidnapping
 * moving normal
 * moving binary tree recursive
 * root fix
 * leaf fix

# operations we could teach with linked lists
check whether the tile is empty
accessing the node and modify it or obtain information on it
traversing to see if the node is 

trees can be represented traditionally as parent and child relationships
or a lists of list or a linked lists of linked lists.



#End
Once you find the player at the end of the last level he is happy to see you
and the story ends.


## Game mechanics
* Learning goals have to be essential for winning or the material is likely to be 
ignored.

# reward system for gratification - immediate and long term
What rewards can we give
- floor bot esque light up technique?
- items like stars to pick up
- flashy visuals like nyan cat songs to play?


### Player and victim relationship
The players character reject the victim - hence the player will feel guilt when
the other character gets kidnapped. 
We get to name the player's character and the victim.
make the player play the victim and then get kidnapped.
Make the victim be related to the player - blood ?

Make the victim do something interactive - think wolf among us starting fight.

### What makes a game interesting?
of the player and the context within the game. Satisfies the learning objective.
* Storyline - a fantasy context makes the player more likely motivated to succeed at 
the game. Escape into their studies.

* Flexibility - make sure there are many ways to accomplish each goal.
As much as possible, let the player work out their own strategy to the ned.

* Immediate and useful rewards - player should be rewarded appropriately.
